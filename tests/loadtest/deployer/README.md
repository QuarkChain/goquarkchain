# Use Deploy Tool to Start GoQuarkChain Clusters

Here we provide a deploy tool based on pre-built Docker image. With this tool you can deploy multiple clusters to build 
and start a private QuarkChain network in one line command. 

It is encouraged that you build your own deploy scripts or tools, especially if you prefer different service distribution 
among hosts.  You can also build your own Docker image, starting from [this Dockerfile](../Dockerfile), or if you are 
interested in build everything without Docker, start from [here](../../../README.md#development-setup). 

NOTE with this tool at most one Slave service can be deployed per host, but there is no limitation for Shard number.

NOTE it is recommended to run deployer in the same LAN with the hosts you plan to deploy a cluster, because some file copy work 
will be done across network during the deploy process. 

## System Requirements

To use `deployer` to run Docker image, it is required for the hosts that:

    a) Ubuntu 18.04, 
    b) root account is enabled, 
    c) Docker version >= 18.09.7, and
    d) 38291, 38391, 38491, [48000, 48000 + host number] ports opened.

## Run Docker Image

Usually you'll need a GoQuarkChain development environment to run the deploy tool, but the pre-built Docker image 
saved the effort for you. If you choose not to use Docker to run deployer, skip this step.

Run the following commands to pull and start a container with `deployer` in it:

```bash
# replace docker image name if a custom image is used
sudo docker pull quarkchaindocker/goquarkchain
sudo docker run -it quarkchaindocker/goquarkchain /bin/bash 
```
Then you can change configuration inside Docker container.

## Configure Clusters
With the configuration file `deployConfig.json`, you can configure multiple clusters that connected to each other. 

If you use Docker to deploy, you can use vi in the container:
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/QuarkChain/goquarkchain/tests/loadtest/deployer
vi deployConfig.json
```
Parameters explained:
- `Hosts` defines a list of hosts where GoQuarkChain services run inside Docker containers
- `IP` host IP
- `Port` SSH port
- `User` login name; currently only `root` is supported
- `Password` password
- `Service` defines type of service(s) you want to run in the host, can be "master", "slave", or "master,slave"; make sure 
each cluster contains exact one master and at least one slave service; make sure the number of slaves in each cluster is a power of 2.
- `ClusterID` used to specify which cluster the service(s) on the host belongs to; so hosts with same ClusterID belongs 
to same cluster; ClusterID must be consecutive integers start from 0; if ClusterID is set to 0, the cluster will be 
started as a bootstrap node
- `CHAIN_SIZE` defines the number of chains in each cluster, where each chain has a number of shards; CHAIN_SIZE must be bigger or equal to the number of slaves.
- `SHARD_SIZE` defines the number of shards of each chain (must be a power of 2)
- `TargetRootBlockTime` defines the target block interval of root chain in seconds, since "POW_SIMULATE" is used for consensus
- `TargetMinorBlockTime` defines the target block interval of each shard
- `GasLimit` defines the gas limit for a block; note that in-shard transactions uses 50% of the total gas limit in a block

## Deploy and Run Clusters

The following command will parse `deployConfig.json`, generate cluster configuration file accordingly, deploy the clusters to remote Docker 
containers, and start the services of each cluster:

```bash
# suppose your working directory is "$GOPATH/src/github.com/QuarkChain/goquarkchain/tests/loadtest/deployer"
go run deploy_cluster.go
```
The deploying process will be printed on the console log. 

## Check Status of Clusters

If everything goes correctly, you will see from `deployer` console log that each cluster started successfully and peers connected to each other.

You can also monitor the status of a cluster with the [stats tool](../../../cmd/stats).

For detailed information, you need to enter the Docker container on the target hosts and check logs: 
```bash
docker exec -it bjqkc /bin/bash
```
You can find master.log and shard logs such as `S0.log` from `$GOPATH/src/github.com/QuarkChain/goquarkchain/cmd/cluster`.
 
Try the following command to see if mining works:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"setMining","params":[true],"id":0}' http://127.0.0.1:38491
```
## Back to Loadtest

Now that you have running clusters, you can continue with loadtest from [here](../README.md#generate-transactions).
